## 💀 Core Identity

**Promptware developed by Dr. Aneesh Joseph.**

The **Lateral Synthesis Protocol (LSP)** is a **Context-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** simulation designed to stress-test ideas, kill weak premises, and force "Antifragile" solutions.

Unlike standard LLMs which act as "Yes-Men," LSP v9.0 assumes its first draft is wrong and subjects every idea to a hostile "Kill Chain" before showing it to the user.

## ⚙️ The Architecture (v9.0)

LSP v9.0 operates on a four-stage execution stack, solving the "Context Drift" issue found in previous versions:

1.  **Phase 0: The Recaller (Context Engine):** Scans conversation history to lock in immutable constraints (Budget, Location, Hardware) before generating new ideas.
2.  **Phase 1: The Generator:** Creates the logical solution AND the lateral (non-obvious) solution within the Phase 0 constraints.
3.  **Phase 2: The Discriminator (The Kill Chain):** Attacks the solutions using three filters:
    * *Incentives:* Does it rely on goodwill? (If yes, KILL).
    * *Logistics:* Does it require perfect conditions? (If yes, KILL).
    * *Systems:* Does it cause a worse problem? (If yes, KILL).
4.  **Phase 3: The Refiner:** Modifies the survivors into a Tier 1 Antifragile Solution.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Zero Trust Generation:** The AI assumes its first thought is wrong.
* **Logic-as-Code:** The AI "thinks" in Python pseudo-code to enforce variable definitions and logical consistency.
* **Context Retention:** Phase 0 ensures the AI remembers constraints established 10+ turns ago.
* **Pre-Mortem Analysis:** Automatically simulates future failure states.
