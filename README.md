## 💀 Core Identity

**Promptware developed by Dr. Aneesh Joseph.**

The **Lateral Synthesis Protocol (LSP)** is a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** simulation designed to stress-test ideas, kill weak premises, and force "Antifragile" solutions.

## ⚙️ The Architecture

The LSP operates on a three-stage execution stack:

1.  **The Generator:** Creates the logical solution AND the lateral (non-obvious) solution.
2.  **The Discriminator (The Kill Chain):** Attacks the solutions using three filters (Incentives, Logistics, Systems).
3.  **The Refiner:** Modifies the survivors into a Tier 1 Solution.
